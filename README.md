# Circus-Of-Plates
## Game created using Java OOP design principles    
### Design Principles used   
1: Strategy: to implement different game states according game difficulty chosen at the menu screen    
2: Iterator: used to iterate between lists of different objects    
3: Singleton: used to make sure only 1 instance of the clown object is created    
4: Factory: used to create different game objects while not revealing objects classes to the rest of the program    
5: Facade: used to shorten the methods by calling different methods with these code blocks to make reading and maintaining the code easier    
6: Bridge: used to connect between two different classes to reduce coupling between them    
7: Builder: used to create objects made up of multiple complex parts. It separates the construction of an object from its representation   
   
     
## How the game works:    
Player has 3 lives    
A player gains a life if he catches a skittle and loses a life if he catches a bomb    
Score is increased by stacking 3 plates of the same color in a row on the same hand    
Game ends either when you stack 10 plates on a hand or timer (1 minute) ends or you have 0 lives
